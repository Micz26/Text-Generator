# Text Generator

This project implements a simple text generator using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python. The generator is capable of analyzing a given text corpus, creating bigrams, and using the generated model to generate new text based on learned patterns.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to build a basic text generator using NLTK. The generator uses bigrams to predict the next word in a sequence, creating coherent and meaningful text.

## Features

- Tokenization of input text.
- Generation of bigrams from the tokenized text.
- Creation of a dictionary for predicting the next word based on the current word (bigram model).
- Generation of text based on the learned bigram model.
- Basic command-line interface for interacting with the generator.

## Sample Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python main.py`.
2. Input the path to your text corpus file, e.g., `corpus.txt`.
3. The generator will analyze the text and generate sentences based on the learned patterns.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the NLTK library and various text generation tutorials available online.
